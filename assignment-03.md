#### Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2025-2026

## Assigment #03 

v0.5.0-20251205

The last assignment consists of three points

1) *About Event-driven Architectures* 

- Consider the *Shipping on the Air* case study and refine the  solution developed in previous assignments by adopting an event-driven architecture for one selected microservice (the one that you consider the best candidate for such a reeingineering).
  - The other microservices may keep the original architecture, just adapting what it is needed to interact with the redesigned microservice.
  - Use Apache Kafka as middleware.

2) *About Scaling and Service Levels*  **(preview)**

- Applying scaling strategies to the *Shipping on the Air* case study, in order to achieve specific Service Levels
  - Technologies involved: Kubernetes 

3) *About Agent-based Architectures* **(preview)**

- Consider the specification and design of the autonomous software system controlling a drone in the *Shipping on the Air* case study, applying an agent-oriented approach. 


#### Deliverable
  
The deliverable should include sources and a report. It can be delivered as a project (a repo) on GitHub (or equivalent), properly organised. The link of the project can be submitted on the course web site.
