#### Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2025-2026

## Assigment #01 - *Shipping on the Air*

v1.0.0-20251020

We start from a rough business idea: 
- *we want to build an online system for delivering packages through drones (delivery drones), as a service. Basic need: a user wants to send a package (of some weight) from one place to other place, on some specific date/time (including immediately), within some amount of time.  The user may want to track the delivering process, knowing exactly where the package is and how much time is left to complete the delivery.*

#### Objective of the assigment:

- Develop a process including analysis, design and development of a prototype, focusing on core/strategic/essential functionalities and features. 
- The adopted design and development should be based on the principles, methods and styles studied in the course. In particular:
  - Domain-Driven Design should be adopted as methodological approach from analysis to development.
  - Microservices architectural style should be adopted as architectural style.
- The main effort should be put on aspects that are relevant from an architectural point of view (from requirements to development).

#### Deliverable
  
- Living doc, versioned, including: 
  - Analisys artifacts, documenting functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Design artifacts, documenting models and software architectures.
- A prototype and a short video, reproducing a demo of the core features.

The deliverable can be realised as project on git-based platforms on the cloud (e.g. GitHub), properly organised. The link of the project can be submitted on the course web site.
