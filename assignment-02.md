#### Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2025-2026

## Assigment #02 - *Shipping on the Air* with Patterns

v1.0.0-20251114

#### Objective of the assigment:

- Consider the *Shipping on the Air* case study presented in assignment #01. In assignment #02, we want to refine the design, implementation and deployment by applying a subset of the microservices patterns discussed in the course. In particular:
  - API Gateway
  - Observability Patterns
    - Health chek API
    - Application Metrics
  - Event Sourcing - applied to one service   
  - Two more patterns, of your choice

- Besides patterns, the solution must adopt:
  - A deployment strategy, based on software containers.   
  - A testing strategy, showing one example for each level of the test pyramid.  
 
- Discuss how to use observability patterns to implement Quality Attribute Scenarios in your project, providing two concrete examples.

#### Deliverable
  
The deliverable should include sources and a report, briefly describing at the architectural level how patterns have been implemented. It can be delivered as a project (a repo) on GitHub (or equivalent), properly organised. The link of the project can be submitted on the course web site.
